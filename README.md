# BellyButton_PlotlyJS

This dataset is based on the results from the first 60 belly buttons analyzed.

This website uses Plotily (Javascript), HTML, CSS, and Python Flask Server. These key features of the website help develop a live and interactive website. The HTML inserts the context and ID's from JS to improve the communication.
